# Coding Sample
As a student working on Assignment of csc108, I am building a club recommender system by completing and expanding the provided club_functions.py file. My first step is to carefully fill in all missing docstrings, ensuring that each function is clearly documented with examples. I then need to implement six major functions—such as load_profiles, get_average_club_count, and recommend_clubs—while designing helper functions where necessary to keep the code clean and efficient. Along the way, I am responsible for writing thorough pytest unit tests in test_get_average_club_count.py and test_get_last_to_first.py to verify that my functions behave correctly. Following the assignment's expectations, I will structure my data using person-to-friends and person-to-clubs dictionaries. I also plan to use a3_checker.py to confirm that my style and function signatures meet the requirements. After completing all coding and testing, I will submit the necessary files and use club_finder.py to interactively test my recommender system and make sure it runs smoothly.
